# Implementation Summary: Leave

**Package:** `Nexus\Leave`  
**Status:** Development (40% complete)  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-04  
**Version:** 1.0.0-alpha

## Executive Summary

The Leave package provides pure domain logic for leave management operations including leave applications, balance calculations, accrual strategies, and policy validation. The package is framework-agnostic and follows contract-driven design principles.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Complete)
- [x] Define core contracts/interfaces (9 interfaces)
- [x] Create leave-related enums (5 enums)
- [x] Implement base exception hierarchy (3 exceptions)
- [x] Set up accrual strategy pattern

### Phase 2: Balance Management (In Progress)
- [x] LeaveBalanceCalculator service structure
- [ ] Implement balance calculation logic
- [ ] Implement accrual calculation logic
- [ ] Add balance adjustment operations
- [ ] Create balance snapshot mechanism

### Phase 3: Accrual Strategies (In Progress)
- [x] MonthlyAccrualStrategy structure
- [x] FixedAllocationStrategy structure
- [ ] Implement monthly accrual logic
- [ ] Implement fixed allocation logic
- [ ] Add quarterly accrual strategy
- [ ] Add yearly accrual strategy
- [ ] Create custom law-adjusted strategy

### Phase 4: Policy Validation (Planned)
- [ ] Leave overlap detection service
- [ ] Policy compliance validator
- [ ] Carry-forward processor
- [ ] Encashment calculator

### Phase 5: Testing & Documentation (Planned)
- [ ] Unit tests for all services
- [ ] Integration tests for workflows
- [ ] Complete API documentation

### Enums (5 enums)
| Enum | File | Cases |
|------|------|-------|
| `LeaveStatus` | `src/Enums/LeaveStatus.php` | DRAFT, PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED, CANCELLED |
| `ApprovalStatus` | `src/Enums/ApprovalStatus.php` | PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED |
| `LeaveCategory` | `src/Enums/LeaveCategory.php` | ANNUAL, SICK, MATERNITY, PATERNITY, UNPAID, COMPASSIONATE, STUDY, OTHER |
| `LeaveDuration` | `src/Enums/LeaveDuration.php` | FULL_DAY, HALF_DAY_AM, HALF_DAY_PM, HOURS |
| `AccrualFrequency` | `src/Enums/AccrualFrequency.php` | MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, YEARLY, FIXED_ALLOCATION |

### Exceptions (3 exceptions)
| Exception | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `LeaveException` | `src/Exceptions/LeaveException.php` | Base exception class |
| `InsufficientBalanceException` | `src/Exceptions/InsufficientBalanceException.php` | Balance validation |
| `LeaveNotFoundException` | `src/Exceptions/LeaveNotFoundException.php` | Leave record not found |

### Services (3 services)
| Service | File | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| `LeaveBalanceCalculator` | `src/Services/LeaveBalanceCalculator.php` | Structure only |
| `MonthlyAccrualStrategy` | `src/Services/AccrualStrategies/MonthlyAccrualStrategy.php` | Structure only |
| `FixedAllocationStrategy` | `src/Services/AccrualStrategies/FixedAllocationStrategy.php` | Structure only |

## What Is Planned for Future

### Services (Planned)
- `LeaveAccrualEngine` - Process accruals for employees
- `LeavePolicyValidator` - Validate leave requests against policies
- `LeaveOverlapDetector` - Detect overlapping leave requests
- `CarryForwardProcessor` - Handle year-end carry-forward
- `LeaveEncashmentCalculator` - Calculate encashment amounts
- `QuarterlyAccrualStrategy` - Quarterly accrual implementation
- `YearlyAccrualStrategy` - Yearly accrual implementation
- `LawAdjustedAccrualStrategy` - Country-specific statutory compliance

### Value Objects (Planned)
- `LeaveBalance` - Immutable balance representation
- `LeaveEntitlement` - Entitlement rules
- `LeavePeriod` - Date range for leave
- `AccrualRate` - Accrual configuration

### Entities (Planned)
- `Leave` - Leave request entity
- `LeaveType` - Leave type configuration

## What Was NOT Implemented (and Why)

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Leave approval workflow | Belongs in orchestrators layer (HumanResourceOperations) |
| Leave calendar integration | External system integration, belongs in adapters |
| Leave notifications | Handled by Nexus\Notifier package |
| Leave audit logging | Handled by Nexus\AuditLogger package |

## Key Design Decisions

- **Strategy Pattern for Accruals:** Different organizations have different accrual methods. The strategy pattern allows pluggable accrual logic without modifying core services.
- **Country Law Repository:** Statutory leave requirements vary by country. A separate repository interface allows country-specific rules to be injected.
- **Separation of Balance vs. Leave:** Leave requests and leave balances are managed separately to support complex scenarios (multiple balance adjustments per leave).
- **Half-Day Support:** LeaveDuration enum supports AM/PM half-days for granular leave tracking.

## Metrics

### Code Metrics
- Total Lines of Code: ~350
- Total Lines of actual code (excluding comments/whitespace): ~280
- Total Lines of Documentation: ~100
- Cyclomatic Complexity: Low
- Number of Classes: 6
- Number of Interfaces: 9
- Number of Service Classes: 3
- Number of Value Objects: 0 (planned)
- Number of Enums: 5

### Test Coverage
- Unit Test Coverage: 0% (tests planned)
- Integration Test Coverage: 0% (tests planned)
- Total Tests: 0

### Dependencies
- External Dependencies: 0 (pure PHP)
- Internal Package Dependencies: 0 (standalone domain package)

## Known Limitations

1. **No Entity Implementations:** Only interfaces defined; consuming applications must implement entities
2. **Stub Service Methods:** Service methods contain TODO stubs, not actual logic
3. **No Validation Logic:** Policy validation methods not yet implemented
4. **Missing Value Objects:** Planned VOs for type safety not yet created

## Integration Examples

This package integrates with the HumanResourceOperations orchestrator for:
- Leave approval workflows
- Balance recalculation triggers
- Notification dispatch on status changes
